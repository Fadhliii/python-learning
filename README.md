#### Day 5 - Learning Python
#### Project: Jankenpo (Rock-Paper-Scissors)

"""
What I learned today:
- How to use random.choice() to randomly select item from a list
- Variables can be used inside for loops
- A loop variable temporarily stores each value from the sequence (list, range, etc.)
  - It take the 1st value in the 1st iteration
  - Then the next value in the next iteration
  - Until the last value in the final iteration
- adding append function to make a random to be a list
- change a list that has been shuffled to be string
